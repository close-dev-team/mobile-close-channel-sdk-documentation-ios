# Access to the binary

⛔️ The binary of the SDK framework is in a private repository: https://github.com/close-dev-team/mobile-close-channel-sdk-binary-ios. Please first contact [us](mailto:maurice@thecloseapp.com) to get access to this repository. Make sure you received and accepted the invite before you continue.

Then use a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub as explained below to clone the repository of the SDK framework binary. Use this token later when asked for a username and password for access to private repository.

## Creating a Personal Access Token

* Select *Developer Settings* in the menu
* Select *Personal access tokens*
