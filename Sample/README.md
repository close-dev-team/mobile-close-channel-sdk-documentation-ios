## Registering a user
The first time you start the app and open the Channels list, you'll see a *Could not retrieve list of channels / API call failed - User not valid* message.

This means that you first have to register a user.

Go to the *Options* tab and tap *Register user*

>This will do a [registerUser()](../doc/SDK%20Reference%20Documentation/classes/CloseChannelController.md) call with the values you provide. If you leave the values empty, they will be sent as a *nil* value. Any errors are shown in a popup.

## Adding a channel

When the user is registered, a channel can be added. Go to the *Options* tab and tap *Add channel*. Then type for example `DEMO` to add a channel.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ask Close for other show codes.

>This will do an [addChannel()](../doc/SDK%20Reference%20Documentation/classes/CloseChannelController.md) call with the value you provide. Any errors are shown in a popup.

## Opening a channel

In the *Options* tab and tap *Open latest channel (messages)* or *Open latest channel (info)* to open a the latest added channel in either of the views.

>This will do a [openChannelMessagesView(channelId: nil) or openChannelInfoView(channelId: nil)](../doc/SDK%20Reference%20Documentation/classes/CloseChannelController.md) call. Any errors are shown in a popup.

In the *Channels* tab you'll find an overview of all channels. This show how you use the information in the Channel object to build up a UITableView.

>The channels are retrieved via an [getChannels()](../doc/SDK%20Reference%20Documentation/classes/CloseChannelController.md)

Tapping on it allows you to open it in one of the views.

>This will do a [openChannelMessagesView() or openChannelInfoView()](../doc/SDK%20Reference%20Documentation/classes/CloseChannelController.md) call, with the channel ID of that channel.

## Push notifications

The sample app show how to identify push notifications from Close and how to parse and use the information in it. It also implements opening a channel after tapping a push notification.

‚ö†Ô∏è Push notifications are not shown in the sample app when your are using the standard SDK test environment. Contact Close to setup a separate environment for testing push notifications.

Detailed information on push notifications can be found [here](../doc/push_notifications.md)
